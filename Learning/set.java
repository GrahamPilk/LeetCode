         * The Set Interface is part of the Java Collections Framework and is used to store a collection of unique elements. 
         * Unlike a list, a set does not allow duplicates. and it does not preserve the order of elements (unless you are using TreeSet  or LinkedHashSet)
         * Common classes that implement set
         *      HashSet - fash and unorderd
         *      TreeSet - sorted set
         *      LinkedHashSet - ordered by insertion. 
         * Tip: Use a Set when you need to Store unique values only
         * 
         * Common Set Methods
         *      add() - adds an element if its not alr in the set
         *      remove() - removes the element from the set
         *      contains() - Checks if the set contains the element
         *      size() - returns the number of elements
         *      clear() - removes all elements
         * 
         * Set vs List
         *      Set: Does not allow duplicates, Does not gurantee order, No index based access
         *      List: Allows Duplicates, Maintains Order, Access by index
         *
